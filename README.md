# Riak Lab
This is a quick tutorial and excercise on getting started with Basho's
Riak KV. In this excercise, you will gain a basic overview of the Riak
data model and how to setup and configure your own Riak cluster. This
excercise is accompanied with a few `python` snippets on how you might
use certain functionalities of Riak. In addition, we offer a short
excercise demonstrating how you might implement a Craigslist clone
backed by Riak.
